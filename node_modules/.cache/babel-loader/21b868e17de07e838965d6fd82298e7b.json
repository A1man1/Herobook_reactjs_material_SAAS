Management style belongs to management strategy; it can be composed of operation strategy, company culture and managers.

It can be an educational tool. there is a considerable variety of TV programmes which give us instruction as well as education . there are , for examples , some programmes for educating adult illiterates and others for teaching foreign languages . besides ,a lot of films, plays and series are presented time at home . Television also provides outlet for creative talents . many playwrights ,actors emerged from television . color TV has given greater opportunities for such talents. However ,television is a bad master . it has a negative effect on our behavior It encourages us to accept violence and to be inactive and unimaginative. it occupies most of our time . thus , we have no time left to pursue our hobbies , listen to music or read books . it also regulates our free time . we rush home ,gulp food and then sit in complete silence before the TV screen . Many television channels broadcast violent films and programs. The more our children see violence on television , the less sensitive they become to it . So , violence doesn\\u2019t seem wrong . We can also notice that violence on television doesn\\u2019t seem to have consequence s . An actor who is killed in a film an hour ago ,can be seen laughing in another program . This may confuse with reality and we forget killing must be permanent Television also encourages passive enjoyment it is a tool to cut us off from the real world .We become less active . We do nothing except turning it on and changing the channels . We can\\u2019t even move around to practice sports . we get little so lazy and of course we will suffer from physical diseases . we choose to spend a fine day in semi \\u2018darkness ,glued to our sets , rather than go out into the world itself. Besides , its bad effect concerning social relationship, we notice that TV cuts the soul of gathering people in one trend . In addition, we notice the bad morals that spread in society among people . Crimes spread as a result of bad films and forcing scenes . social illnesses prevail over the countries Addiction to watching TV acts as a hindrance to our imagination . Stories are told for us . We don\\u2019t even have to imagine what the place of stories look like On my opinion . television can tight relations . News and other information , we see on television gives us topics to discuss with our friends and family . Television also helps us to understand each other better as we all have access to its programmes . TV can help us share our interests with other people . Television programmes give us topics to think about . Now we can know about news in a few minutes after they happen all over the world . For example , now we know about those who die of birds flu minutes after the event . We all like to discuss these matters with other people . So , Television news and information programmes help us to discuss our ideas with others . No matter where you live ,you have access to many television channels . You can watch television programmes and movies of many other foreign countries . through them you can get information about many different cultures . When you go to a new city to work , study or take a vacation , you will already have something in common with the people there . Where you meet new people ,you will probably be familiar with at least some of the television programs they watch . The gives you something to talk about and a way to begin new friendships\"), /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(Typography, {\n  paragraph: true,\n  __self: this,\n  __source: {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 175,\n    columnNumber: 5\n  }\n}, \"Most people use television as a way to pursue their interest .

Both styles have their proponents as well as their detractors. This paper will outline the various forms of management and attempt to clarify and categorize their various     strengths and weaknesses\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography paragraph>\n        As previously mentioned, this form of management does not consider what the subordinates or employees think; but rather allows the members of management to make unilateral decisions…show more content…\nGoleman also warns that “the democratic style can have its drawbacks. One results when a leader over relies on this approach is exasperating, endless meetings in which ideas are mulled over, consensus remains elusive, and the only visible outcome is to schedule yet more meetings (Goleman, Boyatzis and McKee).”\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography paragraph>\n      The management culture provides the developing direction of a company.  It decides the characteristic and company culture in an enterprise.  However, the style can be influenced by certain factors, such as, policy, history background, social system, international competition.  In this essay, three management styles and two company types will be indentified and discussed.\nManagement style belongs to management strategy; it can be composed of operation strategy, company culture and managers.  To be specific, different management styles have distinct characterizations, which can be divided many particular aspects.  For instances, Asian styles of management is originated from western styles; however, Asian styles and western styles have…show more content…\nThis situation can be explained by Chinese mood.  Wang (2010) indicated that the cultural background, policy and economic conditions of the country have suffered Chinese managers to confuse the existed management styles, which requires a new way to get accustomed to modern market.  Moreover, some internal and external factors should be considered between Chinese style and western style.\n\n    </Typography>\n  </Fragment>\n);\nconst content6 = (\n  <Fragment>\n    <Typography variant=\"h6\" paragraph>\n      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy\n      eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography paragraph>\n      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy\n      eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam\n      voluptua.

It can be an educational tool. there is a considerable variety of TV programmes which give us instruction as well as education . there are , for examples , some programmes for educating adult illiterates and others for teaching foreign languages . besides ,a lot of films, plays and series are presented time at home . Television also provides outlet for creative talents . many playwrights ,actors emerged from television . color TV has given greater opportunities for such talents.\nHowever ,television is a bad master . it has a negative effect on our behavior It encourages us to accept violence and to be inactive and unimaginative. it occupies most of our time . thus , we have no time left to pursue our hobbies , listen to music or read books . it also regulates our free time . we rush home ,gulp food and then sit in complete silence before the TV screen . Many television channels broadcast violent films and programs. The more our children see violence on television , the less sensitive they become to it . So , violence doesn’t seem wrong . We can also notice that violence on television doesn’t seem to have consequence s . An actor who is killed in a film an hour ago ,can be seen laughing in another program . This may confuse with reality and we forget killing must be permanent\nTelevision also encourages passive enjoyment it is a tool to cut us off from the real world .We become less active . We do nothing except turning it on and changing the channels . We can’t even move around to practice sports . we get little so lazy and of course we will suffer from physical diseases . we choose to spend a fine day in semi ‘darkness ,glued to our sets , rather than go out into the world itself. Besides , its bad effect concerning social relationship, we notice that TV cuts the soul of gathering people in one trend . In addition, we notice the bad morals that spread in society among people . Crimes spread as a result of bad films and forcing scenes . social illnesses prevail over the countries Addiction to watching TV acts as a hindrance to our imagination . Stories are told for us . We don’t even have to imagine what the place of stories look like\nOn my opinion . television can tight relations . News and other information , we see on television gives us topics to discuss with our friends and family . Television also helps us to understand each other better as we all have access to its programmes . TV can help us share our interests with other people . Television programmes give us topics to think about . Now we can know about news in a few minutes after they happen all over the world . For example , now we know about those who die of birds flu minutes after the event . We all like to discuss these matters with other people . So , Television news and information programmes help us to discuss our ideas with others . No matter where you live ,you have access to many television channels . You can watch television programmes and movies of many other foreign countries . through them you can get information about many different cultures . When you go to a new city to work , study or take a vacation , you will already have something in common with the people there . Where you meet new people ,you will probably be familiar with at least some of the television programs they watch . The gives you something to talk about and a way to begin new friendships\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography paragraph>\n      Most people use television as a way to pursue their interest . People who play sports usually like to watch sports on television . Those who like to cook prefer to watch cooking programs . Television encourage s communication among people . Television is a tool that gives access to information and entertainment as well as education . You can share others’ interests effectively\nTechnology is also needed to raise our standard of living . our homes are more comfortable and use fewer energy recourses thanks to improvements in home construction techniques as well as computer technology . without technology we couldn’t have treatments for heart diseases thanks to progress in medicine\nFrom the above ‘ mentioned lines we come to a conclusion that says “technology is good ” Without it there would be no change ,no improvement s in our economy ,our standard of living , or our health . Hence , We can’t deny the necessity of technology.\n    </Typography>\n  </Fragment>\n);\nexport default [\n  {\n    title: \"Data Science\",\n    id: 1,\n    imageSrc: blogPost1,\n    snippet:\n      \"one of the most significant advances of this century, refers to an emerging area related to the collection, preparation, analysis, visualization, management, and preservation of this data – both structured and unstructured.To discover, extract, compile, process, analyze, interpret, and visualize data, data science ..\",\n    content: content1\n  },\n  {\n    title: \"Management Styles\",\n    id: 2,\n    imageSrc: blogPost2,\n    snippet:\n      \"There are several very different types of management styles ranging from democratic which allows the subordinates to play an active role in the decisions that management makes to autocratic which cuts the subordinate out of the decision making process allowing those in management to make a unilateral decision.

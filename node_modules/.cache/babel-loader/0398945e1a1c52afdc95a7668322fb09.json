I wasn't willing to let it go, but now it hangs on a bulletin board and isn't stuffed in a drawer. My children's artwork was the hardest. But instead of packing the endless projects away, I used the Artkive app to create digital records of their drawings.

Vector graphics use geometrical points, lines, curves, and shapes based on mathematical equations. When it comes to editing vector graphics the image can be changed by editing the screen objects which are saved as modifications. The size of the file depends on the resolution required. Once a file is converted from vector format, it is bigger, and it loses the advantage of scalability. Vector formats are not the best for all graphic works, such as for editing pictures from digital cameras. 3D computer graphics are graphics that use three-dimensional representations of geometric data. One of the primary uses of 3D computer graphics is Computer-aided design. Computer-aided design (or CAD for short) is the use of computer technology for the purpose of designing objects. CAD is an important industrial art that is used in many applications, including automotive, shipbuilding, and aerospace industries. CAD was started in the late 1980s and began a trend of downsizing in drafting departments. One CAD operator could replace three to five drafters (McGuire-Lyte).

It decides the characteristic and company culture in an enterprise.  However, the style can be influenced by certain factors, such as, policy, history background, social system, international competition.  In this essay, three management styles and two company types will be indentified and discussed.\nManagement style belongs to management strategy; it can be composed of operation strategy, company culture and managers.  To be specific, different management styles have distinct characterizations, which can be divided many particular aspects.

Wang (2010) indicated that the cultural background, policy and economic conditions of the country have suffered Chinese managers to confuse the existed management styles, which requires a new way to get accustomed to modern market.  Moreover, some internal and external factors should be considered between Chinese style and western style.\n\n    </Typography>\n  </Fragment>\n);\nconst content6 = (\n  <Fragment>\n    <Typography variant=\"h6\" paragraph>\n      Introduction 3.

Because it provides the proper security to the message. And in now days everybody wants the proper security for our message so that the original message as it is read by the recipient that are send by the sender without any changes/alternation in the message. So this is the very important topic to cover up and secure our messages from unauthorized user’s access. That provide the security to our communication. So, we can easily communicate without any afraid of hacking of data.\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION:-\t\t Encryption is the most effective way to provide the data security. It is a process which converts original information into a difficult-to-interpret form. The original information is known as plain text and the converted information/message is commonly known as cipher text.\n\nIn now a days you email delicate, individual and business data to your recipients, then encryption is likely a need. But still 99% of all emails movement goes\nShow More\nRelated\n\n    Trust And Encryption Based Smart Path Routing Protocol For Manets\n\n\n    Trust and Encryption based Smart Path Routing protocol for MANETs Authors Name/s per 1st Affiliation (Author) Dept. name of organization (Line 1 of Affiliation - optional) Name of organization - acronyms acceptable (line 2) City, Country (line 3) name@xyz.com – optional (line 4) Authors Name/s per 2nd Affiliation (Author) Dept. name of organization (Line 1 of Affiliation - optional) Name of organization - acronyms acceptable (line 2) City, Country (line 3) name@xyz.com – optional (line 4)\n\n    </Typography>\n  </Fragment>\n);\nconst content4 = (\n  <Fragment>\n    <Typography variant=\"h6\" paragraph>\n     We love the little hacks and tweaks that can make your home tidier, but the truth is that big change in the way you organize requires ... well, a big change in the way you live. We teamed up with organizing coach Maeve Richmond to get the inside scoop on one of her latest client success stories. Dawn Nadeau is a mom who never thought she'd get her home organized — until she took a long look at not only her stuff, but also herself.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography paragraph>\n     When we moved into our home eight years ago, I had two little kids and was anxious to just get stuff away. So the temporary homes I gave things eventually became their permanent homes — and it wasn't working.\n\nMaeve convinced me that every single thing had to come out — only then can you be confident that you've processed it all. I'd neglected this step in previous cleaning frenzies. I would purge the top layer of stuff pretty easily, and then \"rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic,\" if you will, in nearly the same way — maybe add some fancy new boxes to contain all the stuff.\nRoom, House, Interior design, Furniture, Table, Home, Leisure, Collection, Building,\nMaeve Richmond\n\nBut it would always just backlog again. One of Maeve's rules is that nothing goes back the way it was. Every time we cleared out a spot, we ended up changing what lived there — no longer would I let my stuff dictate my actions. Instead, I reimagined each space and I dictated how my stuff would work for me (more on that later).\nI gave myself permission to let things go.\n\nThis is tough for anyone, but it's a crucial step in regaining control over your stuff.\n\nI was really honest with myself, and resolved to not beat myself up over getting rid of (or donating) things we didn't need — even if they were in good shape. When you start to think of your things as part of an ecosystem for your life, it becomes easier to pare down to only the stuff you really love.\nGetting Organized\nElizabeth Griffin\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nOf course, there was compromise. We came upon a lottery ticket that my father had bought not long before he passed away. I wasn't willing to let it go, but now it hangs on a bulletin board and isn't stuffed in a drawer.\n\nMy children's artwork was the hardest. But instead of packing the endless projects away, I used the Artkive app to create digital records of their drawings. And then I put the ones we didn't save in a black garbage bag, took a deep breath, and walked away.\nI really took stock of what my day (and week, and month) looked like.\n\nWhen it comes to decluttering, you can't put the horse before the cart — what works for a friend (or what you've spied on Pinterest) will fail if it doesn't fit into your life.\n\nWhen I was clearing out my closet, I looked closely at my month. How many school meetings do I have? How often do I go out to dinner? When I figured out what clothes I really needed in my wardrobe (and what was just extra junk) it was really eye-opening.\n\nMaeve and I walked through my daily life, and she'd ask me to pause at important moments. Where would I naturally drop my keys? Or my purse? I changed where items live so they work for how I use them — and fought the urge to store things in places just because they happened to fit there.\nI made it a priority to take care of myself.\n\nFrankly, I was 40-year-old and dressing like a 20-year-old. I'd buy the same clothes over and over again because I wasn't ever sure what I owned — or, more importantly, what I really needed. When I cleared out my closet, I had eight garbage bags worth of stuff, and it was a real moment of truth. Really? I care so little about myself that I bought and stored all this veritable junk?\n\n    If the general state of my home is in chaos, I'm in chaos—and I don't want to feel like that again.\n    </Typography>\n\n  </Fragment>\n);\nconst content5 = (\n  <Fragment>\n    <Typography variant=\"h6\" paragraph>\n      Computer Graphics Design has changed in many ways over the years. In the beginning there were 2-Dimensional shapes such as you would see in the game “Pong.” Many years later, graphics improved, changing from 2-Dimensional shapes into 3-Dimensional characters, which are standard in video games, movies, and television today. There are many different image types for graphics: 2D computer graphics, pixel art, vector graphics, 3D computers graphics, and computer animation.\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography paragraph>\n      Over the years, computer graphic design programs have been created for public use, one example being the program Blender 3D.

Whether…show more content…\nPixel art is still a popular art used in online virtual worlds like Habbo and many hand held devices such as the Nintendo DS and cell phones. Vector graphics use geometrical points, lines, curves, and shapes based on mathematical equations. When it comes to editing vector graphics the image can be changed by editing the screen objects which are saved as modifications. The size of the file depends on the resolution required. Once a file is converted from vector format, it is bigger, and it loses the advantage of scalability. Vector formats are not the best for all graphic works, such as for editing pictures from digital cameras. 3D computer graphics are graphics that use three-dimensional representations of geometric data. One of the primary uses of 3D computer graphics is Computer-aided design. Computer-aided design (or CAD for short) is the use of computer technology for the purpose of designing objects. CAD is an important industrial art that is used in many applications, including automotive, shipbuilding, and aerospace industries. CAD was started in the late 1980s and began a trend of downsizing in drafting departments. One CAD operator could replace three to five drafters (McGuire-Lyte). The last image type is computer animation which is the art of creating moving images with the use of computers. The illusion of movement is created by placing an image on the screen and replacing the image with a new image that is slightly\nShow More\nRelated Graphic Description Of Graphic Design    2003 and\n    2014 Graphic Design Graphic design has played a major role in communication ever since the beginning of time. Over the years it has rapidly evolved, changing the way we communicate and how we interpret messages, images, and data. Not until recently has it become essential to business relations and communications. Graphic design is defined as a way of communicating using different visual mediums to advocate information.

It can be an educational tool. there is a considerable variety of TV programmes which give us instruction as well as education . there are , for examples , some programmes for educating adult illiterates and others for teaching foreign languages . besides ,a lot of films, plays and series are presented time at home . Television also provides outlet for creative talents . many playwrights ,actors emerged from television . color TV has given greater opportunities for such talents.\nHowever ,television is a bad master . it has a negative effect on our behavior It encourages us to accept violence and to be inactive and unimaginative. it occupies most of our time . thus , we have no time left to pursue our hobbies , listen to music or read books . it also regulates our free time . we rush home ,gulp food and then sit in complete silence before the TV screen . Many television channels broadcast violent films and programs. The more our children see violence on television , the less sensitive they become to it . So , violence doesn’t seem wrong . We can also notice that violence on television doesn’t seem to have consequence s . An actor who is killed in a film an hour ago ,can be seen laughing in another program . This may confuse with reality and we forget killing must be permanent\nTelevision also encourages passive enjoyment it is a tool to cut us off from the real world .We become less active . We do nothing except turning it on and changing the channels . We can’t even move around to practice sports . we get little so lazy and of course we will suffer from physical diseases . we choose to spend a fine day in semi ‘darkness ,glued to our sets , rather than go out into the world itself. Besides , its bad effect concerning social relationship, we notice that TV cuts the soul of gathering people in one trend . In addition, we notice the bad morals that spread in society among people . Crimes spread as a result of bad films and forcing scenes . social illnesses prevail over the countries Addiction to watching TV acts as a hindrance to our imagination . Stories are told for us . We don’t even have to imagine what the place of stories look like\nOn my opinion . television can tight relations . News and other information , we see on television gives us topics to discuss with our friends and family . Television also helps us to understand each other better as we all have access to its programmes . TV can help us share our interests with other people . Television programmes give us topics to think about . Now we can know about news in a few minutes after they happen all over the world . For example , now we know about those who die of birds flu minutes after the event . We all like to discuss these matters with other people . So , Television news and information programmes help us to discuss our ideas with others . No matter where you live ,you have access to many television channels . You can watch television programmes and movies of many other foreign countries . through them you can get information about many different cultures . When you go to a new city to work , study or take a vacation , you will already have something in common with the people there . Where you meet new people ,you will probably be familiar with at least some of the television programs they watch . The gives you something to talk about and a way to begin new friendships\n    </Typography>\n    <Typography paragraph>\n      Most people use television as a way to pursue their interest . People who play sports usually like to watch sports on television . Those who like to cook prefer to watch cooking programs . Television encourage s communication among people . Television is a tool that gives access to information and entertainment as well as education . You can share others’ interests effectively\nTechnology is also needed to raise our standard of living . our homes are more comfortable and use fewer energy recourses thanks to improvements in home construction techniques as well as computer technology . without technology we couldn’t have treatments for heart diseases thanks to progress in medicine\nFrom the above ‘ mentioned lines we come to a conclusion that says “technology is good ” Without it there would be no change ,no improvement s in our economy ,our standard of living , or our health . Hence , We can’t deny the necessity of technology.\n    </Typography>\n  </Fragment>\n);\nexport default [\n  {\n    title: \"Data Science\",\n    id: 1,\n    imageSrc: blogPost1,\n    snippet:\n      \"one of the most significant advances of this century, refers to an emerging area related to the collection, preparation, analysis, visualization, management, and preservation of this data – both structured and unstructured.To discover, extract, compile, process, analyze, interpret, and visualize data, data science ..\",\n    content: content1\n  },\n  {\n    title: \"Management Styles\",\n    id: 2,\n    imageSrc: blogPost2,\n    snippet:\n      \"There are several very different types of management styles ranging from democratic which allows the subordinates to play an active role in the decisions that management makes to autocratic which cuts the subordinate out of the decision making process allowing those in management to make a unilateral decision.
